# TASK:
# You have two agents: a Story Generator and a Story Reviewer that checks the story‚Äôs quality. Use AgentHooks to log the interaction between the two agents.
# Create a custom AgentHooks class for both agents to log when each agent starts, ends, and passes data to the next agent. The Story Reviewer should output a structured review using AgentOutputSchema.
