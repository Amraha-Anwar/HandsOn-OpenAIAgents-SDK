# TASK:
# You want the Story Generator to produce structured output (e.g., story title and content) and use AgentHooks to log the structured output in a specific format.

# Create an agent that generates a story with a title and content, using AgentOutputSchema for structured output, and a custom AgentHooks class to log the title and word count of the story.

# Story(
#     title='An Ambitious Girl',
#     content='Maya lived in the quiet village of Eldoria, a place where the tallest structures were ancient oak trees and
# the loudest sounds were the bleating of sheep. While other children dreamed of simpler lives within the village borders,
# Maya\'s gaze always stretched beyond the distant mountains, her mind filled with blueprints of towering bridges and     
# intricate machinery. Her ambition was a blazing star in the dim sky of local expectations. Resources were scarce. The   
# village school had few books and no science lab, but Maya made do. She devoured every dusty textbook, drew complex      
# diagrams on discarded parchment, and spent hours observing the mechanics of the old water mill, sketching its gears and 
# levers. Her parents, though supportive, often worried about the practicality of her grand dreams. "Engineering is for   
# the city, child," her father would say gently, "not for Eldoria." Yet, Maya was undeterred. She sought out information  
# from visiting merchants, corresponded with distant relatives who lived in larger towns, and even taught herself basic   
# coding from a worn-out manual she found in a forgotten attic trunk. Her evenings were spent under the moonlight, not    
# playing, but studying, calculating, and designing. When the time came for university applications, Maya faced a new     
# hurdle: funding. Scholarships were competitive, and her village had little to offer. But her ambition had made her      
# resourceful. She presented a portfolio of her designs, including a self-designed, sustainable irrigation system that    
# could vastly improve Eldoria\'s crops. Her passion and ingenuity shone through, earning her a full scholarship to the   
# nation\'s top engineering university. Leaving Eldoria, Maya carried not just her modest belongings, but the weight of   
# her village\'s hopes and the fire of her own relentless ambition. She knew the path ahead would be challenging, but for 
# Maya, challenges were simply more problems to engineer solutions for. Her journey had just begun, a testament to the    
# boundless power of a girl who dared to dream bigger than her world.'
